### Polynomial Feature Transform learning for Type 2 Diabetes Risk Factor Discovery by integrating genetic and non-genetic data from the UKBiobank

Health disparities

We need to understand if there are health disparities between different ethnic groups in the context of diabetes. For example, if there is a clinical factor/genetic factor that has a higher importance in one ethnic group than in a another for diabetic patients. To understand how different features contribute to produce the right prediction depending on the ethnic group, we can:

Engineered feature approach - Create engineered features that represent the interaction between the EthnicGroup and any other feature. For example, we enriched the datasets with features: EthnicGroup * alcohol_consumption, EthnicGroup * BMI, EthnicGroup * statin_use, etc.
